<h1 align="center">
  ðŸ“š A C++17 string manipulation library
</h1>

Provides a set of string manipulation functions, many of which are similar to Python string methods.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

-   **Flexible Comparison Options**: Compare strings using either case-sensitive or case-insensitive matching.

-   **Flexible String Matching**: Find substrings within strings using either case-sensitive or case-insensitive matching.

-   **String Splitting and Joining**: Split strings into substrings based on specified delimiters or join multiple strings together with a specified delimiter.

-   **String Transformation**: Transform strings in various ways, such as capitalizing the first letter of each word, centering text within a specified width, expanding tabs to spaces, justifying text to the left or right, replacing substrings with new values, swapping the case of characters or converting them to uppercase or lowercase, etc.

-   **String Trimming**: Remove leading and trailing whitespace or specific characters from strings.

-   **String Formatting**: Provides a very simple yet fast string formatting function. It's at least two times faster than typical solutions based on std::snprintf, such as [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26221725) one (tested with Google Benchmark).
    Additionally, this function is safe and does not throw exceptions, even if passed a nullptr as an argument.

-   **Character and String Classification**: Determine the type of character or string, such as whether it is alphanumeric, alphabetic, ASCII, a digit, graphical, printable, punctuation, whitespace, etc.

And more.

## ðŸ’ª Robust and Reliable

Each function has been thoroughly tested with unit tests to ensure its correctness and reliability. Additionally, the functions in this library do not throw exceptions and do not use RTTI (Run-Time Type Information), making them safe and easy to use in any project.

## ðŸŒŽ Cross-Platform and Dependency-Free

This library is completely self-contained and does not have any external dependencies (except STL). It can be used on any platform that supports C++17 (Windows, Linux, macOS).

## ðŸ’» Usage

To use this library in your project, simply include the header file and call the desired functions. For example:

```cpp
#include <stringpy/title.hpp>

int main()
{
    std::string str = "hello, world!";
    std::string result = strpy::title(str);
    std::cout << result << std::endl; // prints "Hello, World!"

    return 0;
}
```

Or like this:

```cpp
#include <stringpy/stringpy.hpp>

int main()
{
    std::string str = "hello, world!";
    bool result = strpy::ends_with_icase(str, "WORLD!");
    std::cout << strpy::to_string(result) << '\n'; // prints "true"

    return 0;
}
```
